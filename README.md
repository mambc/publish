# Publish
## Overview
This is a [TerraME](http://terrame.org) package that allows one to export the outputs of different Model scenarios to a web server.

## License
Publish is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation. See [publish-license-lgpl-3.0.txt](https://github.com/pedro-andrade-inpe/publish/blob/master/license.txt) for details.

## Instructions
Publish automatically reprojects data to the <b>“EPSG:4326”</b> projection (i.e. GCS_WGS_1984). If the final visualization does not work, please reproject the input data to this projection before creating the application.

## Examples
```lua
import("publish")

Application{
    project = filePath("brazil.tview", "publish"),
    title = "Brazil Application",
    description = "Small application with some data related to Brazil.",
    clean = true,
    output = "BrazilWebMap",
    biomes = View{
        select = "name",
        color = "Set2",
        description = "Brazilian Biomes, from IBGE."
    },
    states  = View{
        color = "yellow",
        description = "Brazilian states."
    }
}
```

    This report presents the methodology and the initial results obtained at the fieldwork along riverine settlements at
    Arapiuns River, tributary of Tapajós River, municipality of Santarém, Pará state, from June 4 th to 15 th , 2012.
    This research reproduces and extends the data collection accomplished for Tapajós communities in 2009, regarding the
    infrastructure and network relations of riverine human settlements. The main objective was to characterize the
    organization and interdependence between settlements concerning to:infrastructure, health and education services,
    land use, ecosystem services provision and perception of welfare.
